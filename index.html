          <h2>The History of Vending Machines</h2>
          <p>The invention of the vending machine started many decades ago. In 17th century England, a primitive version of a vending machine was developed to help those that were working in iron furnaces during their lunch break. A simple way to get food was needed as workers couldn't leave for lunch at noon and return shortly after.</p>
          <p>A piece of bread with a slot cut into it would be dispensed from a container when money was paid -- making it one of the first "coin operated" devices ever created.</p>
          <p>In 1868, an American invented another type of vending machine – this time selling gum on New York train platforms. As time went by, more and more companies were inventing ways to sell their products through automated machines instead of employees. Thefirst machines were large and expensive, but as time went on they became smaller and more affordable.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>The Evolution of Vending Machines</h2>
          <p>In 2017, vending machines have been completely transformed from those that were first invented centuries ago. They have now become far smaller due to the use of technology such as LCD screens and touch-screen interfaces instead of paper pamphlets. In addition to this, wireless technology has also made it much easier for companies to keep track of their inventories so that managers can see how many products are left in each machine at any given time without having to send drivers out on collection runs.</p>
          <p>And with the rise of smart cities , it's likely that automated devices like vending machines will continue to grow in popularity throughout the rest of thecentury.</p>
          <p>Many of the technology used in vending machines today is particularly useful for cash-strapped governments, allowing them to save money on staffing costs. As more schools and public buildings turn to automated solutions for their vending machine needs, it's likely that this trend will continue.</p>
